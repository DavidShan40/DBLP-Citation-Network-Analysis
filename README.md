# DBLP-Citation-Network-Analysis
https://www.aminer.org/citation

Using NetworkX (https://networkx.github.io/) for network analysis (creating network, reporting network statis-
tics, calculating three node centrality measures, and implement two link prediction methods)

1. Select data & create network
define what kind of network I would like to analyze. The options including: 1) treat papers as nodes
and citation relationships as edges, 2) treat authors as nodes, and co-author
relationship as edges, 3) treat authors as nodes, and citation relationship as edges.

2. Network analysis & basic statistics
In this part, I'm report the basic network statistics include: 1) num-
ber of nodes in the network 2) number of edges in the network 3)average degree
of node 4) radius of the network 5) diameter of the network 6) density of the
network. Ref: https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/auto_
examples/basic/plot_properties.html#sphx-glr-autoexamples-basic-plot-
properties-py. Next, draw a figure representing the node degree distribution in the network.

3. Node Centrailty Analysis
Pick three centrality metrics that I'm interested to investigate and report at
least three findings (e.g., what are the nodes with high centrality values, how the
centrality values distributed in the network) Ref. https://networkx.github.
io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/centrality.html

4. Link prediction
Pick one unsupervised and one supervised link prediction algorithm, imple-
ment the algorithms, and compare the performance of the selected two ap-
proaches. You must consider at least one ranking based evaluation metric
and one classication-based evaluation metric.
